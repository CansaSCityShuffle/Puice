How to use it
-------------

If you want to know how to use it, take a look at [the feature file](features/puice.feature).

Maybe you have allready some Kind of Configuration/Injection Framework and you only want to use the [Generic Factory](src/Puice/Factory.php) Puice is providing. If thats the case, you have to write some Gluecode, that implements the [Puice\Config](src/Puice/Config.php) Interface and pass it to the Factory.
